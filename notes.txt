creating arrays:
    all values are set to 0, then assigned values are set
    asm instructions sometimes set 0 in a loop (depends on how many 0s)

printing
    asm calls printf
        printf uses stack, tos is the string, then going down are the values to input

floating point
    used pointer hack (casted float pointer to int pointer), and then printed binary
        hack not at all needed, could literally just print the binary of the float
            although it actually kind of is since bitwise and is only allowed for ints
    seems like
        first bit is sign?
        then four bits for exponent
        then the rest for value

structures
    the assembly just puts structure values on the stack, order they're declared in the structure

so null is actually just 0 cast

things to explore
    that thing linus torvalds mentioned in the ted talk about linked lists
    

other things i would wanna do
    multithreading <-- the library required doesnt come with it D:<
    implementing hash tables
    matrices (implementing/using their one)
    figuring out how to do the stuff i made with other data types
